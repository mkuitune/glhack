Todo Masp:
----------
- repl: words : returns a list of all the words resereved in the current root env (for checking for reserved words)
- contains?
- eval
- all memory allocations of values and their members through masp (wrap new/malloc/delete/free)
- configure memory usage (max heap/array size etc)
- string_to_value
- loop construct
- assoc map key val) -> add key/val to map or set element of vector at key to val
- filter pred coll): return a lazy sequence of items in coll for which predicate
  eturns true.
- drop n coll): return all but first n items (should work also on strings)
- drop-last n s): return all but last n items
- drop-while pred col): return sequence starting from element for which predicate
  returns false. 
- map f collection) (map f coll1 coll2) ...
- merge (merge map1 map2 ...)
- wrap math.h
- figure out how to implement linear algebra operators
- documentation interface: all functions have a doc string, language signifier pair.
- tail recursion
- object interface: IObjectReference, IObjectMemberFunction:
    - IObjectMemberFunction: virtual call(masp, pstart, pend, env) = 0
    - on call ((someobject Foo) x y z) -> if someobject := object
        - find member function pointer pFoo through symbol Foo () -> if found, return pFoo->call(...) 
          where input parameter array is initialized to x, y and z
    - on function wrapping declaration, declare wrapper object:
        - SomeObjectMsp : public IObjectReference
        - with a factory function that constructs SomeObjectMsp pointers, returns them as
          std::shared_ptr<IObjectReference>
        - map filled with singleton anonymous member function reference objects of type
            SomeObjectFooMsp : IObjectMemberFunction
        - factory function itself added to map as __SomeObjectMsp__

- unit tests
- embed interface: access values stored in env values and maps through URIs.

- symbols to pointers const char* to symbol table
    std::map<std::string, int> held in masp (latter integer can be 
    used as a reference counter for the string symbol.)

- inline lambdas:
    - (foo x y) & no defs & no function calls-> fn_inline: env not copied with function (not a closure)
        - if has function calls and those calls are of form fn_inline, then the type of a lambda may
          itself be lowered to fn_inline: For all function and lambda references found traverse those
          until a) a non-fn_inline form is found b) no function references are found. If we reach 
          condition b) then the lambda is legally of fn_inline form. NOTE: The corollary to this is that
          set! _MUST_BE_NOT_ALLOWED_ if the previous value of a symbol is a fn_inline!
        - the scan is done only for values that are already found in env. If the particular value is not
          found then the lambda cannot be declared of form fn_inline.
           
- string operations
- file system handling

Done Masp:
----------
- fix gc: 
	- clean heads array
 	- rebuild references by following root env map

- first
- next
- ffirst (first(first next))
- fnext (first (next x))
- nnext (next (next x))
- nfirst (next (first x))
- type query operators: integer?, float?, string?, map?, vector?, list?
                        fn?, symbol?, boolean?, object?
- make-map constructor
- make-vector constructor
- proper map-access
- configure masp output
- println
- str (print string representation )
- persistent list size, map size
- count
- cons elem seq)
- conj seq elem1 elem2 ...)
- [30.12.2012] def for function : (defn foo (x y) (+ x y) ... ) ->  (def foo (lambda  (x y) (+ x y ) ... ))  
                   := (defn p1 p2 ... pn) -> <name> = nfirst (p1); <lambda-body> = rrest -> (def <name> (lambda <lambda-body>))
- [30.12.2012] clean up parser code

Todo glh:
---------
- virtual scene graph for scene construction, spatial scene graph to compute transforms and bounding boxes
- properties map next to scene graph, properties disconnected from nodes and into properties map, accessible through node id
- all objects inherit from GlhObject with possiblity to now pass containers of heterogenous objects around simply through GlhObject*
- all heap objects allocated in single allocator
- multiple threads with communication using mailboxes:
- simplify graph semantics using bound objects or such (as simple as possible syntax to declare links, ,like
   Link("foo", "output").to("bar", "input")
- mouse drag actions with lambdas. Dragged-onto lambda triggers when object is dragged onto something. Mouse.drag(Mouse::Drag::Onto(), Mouse::Drag::Active())
    - now "Active" lambda can forward the mouse movement to 
- the alternative to this is, that whe mouse starts to drag an object, 
    a new object is created (ObjectMover) that has a join ade in the graph Link("mouse", "output").to("object", "position")
    - if we have a group of objects selected an object mover is created for every one of them
    - when drag ends all objectmovers are passed the id onto which the the mouse was on top when the drag stopped
- selection (a notion that comes to mind): global selection set (only one user, only one context. Selection as a UI feature does not really make sense otherwise. BUT,
                                   can save selection sets)
    - mouse operations etc. automatically target the global selection set? 
    - when e.g. clicking,  with selector tool, erase selection set (unless modifier active, eg. ctrl + but down is not same as plain but down)
    - mouse roles through different tools: e.g. picker-> mouse picks. Property selector-> gets color / material / id whatever wanted property, does
        not clear selection buffer. Selector is the default role. Are roles lambdas bound to the mouse entity?

- different scene graphs for 2d scene and 3d scene (2d scene root transform matrix pixel/dpi bound? Thus would map immediately to screen? Sounds good)
- or, just different roots ("root3d", "root2d")
- 2d layout, automatic background meshes for 2d element containers, that can be set as parents for e.g text
- thread architecture(? maybe silly and not needed if can handle task management from external higher level source):
    - master thread (mt): launches all sub-threads and manages them. No other responsibiliites
    - OpenGL thread (ot): Executes all opengl commands
    - io thread: reads input and output. 
    - graph thread[s]: compute graph operations
    - assets-thread[s](at):
        - compose data from internal and external sources to a form that can be passed to ot 
        - 

- half-edge mesh
- boolean operations
- simple mesh rendering (ogl)
- hidden line mesh rendering (ogl)
- on-screen font rendering (from texture)
- off-screen font rendering (use wavelet rendering, to texture)
- ui scene graph
- masp command line
- inteface to masp through commandlets?
- texture loading
- gpu resource monitoring - record texture and geometry data upper limits and monitor them
    - take into record which assets are / are to be rendered. Note those that will not be rendered this
        round and if running out of gpu memory finalize their GPU instance
- masp interface objects for types passable to shader parameters
    - can. eg. configure shaders through repl:
        * (def g (graphicscontext))
        * ((g AddShader) name geom_shader_str ... )
        * (def mytex (loadtexture "file/path/texture.png"))
        * (def add_var (slotname obj) ((g ShaderVar) name slotname obj))
        * (add_var "tex0" mytex)
